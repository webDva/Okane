## ℹ️ About

A payment helper for web developers, Okane provides a simple interface for creating browser experiences for your customers to effortlessly make payments on your website.

## ❗ Notes

I just started developing it. I plan to create an ES6 class that will allow the user (developer) to easily add Stripe or PayPal payment flows on his or her website *and* I plan to create a corresponding backend server to aid in actually executing business logic with authorized payments.
